# TEC_control

This project is the code for a custom built Thermo Electric Cooler (TEC). It featured a bare Freescale 9s08 microprocessor chip with custom support hardware. The system was capable of taking commands from a keypad for temperature regulation, and information display, displaying temperture and time running on the LCD, and controlling the TEC to keep temperature in a desired range.

It is written entirely in 9s08 assembly.
